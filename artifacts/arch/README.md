High-Level Steps for Implementation
    1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        ○ Historical Data: Collect and store historical reconciliation data (such as transaction amounts, dates, categories, etc.).
        ○ Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the data is in a consistent format (e.g., numerical data normalized).
        ○ Feature Engineering: Extract useful features from the data (e.g., daily totals, average transaction amounts, frequency of transactions, etc.).
    2. Anomaly Detection Model:
        ○ Statistical Models: Use statistical methods (e.g., z-scores, moving averages, standard deviation) to identify when new data points deviate from expected ranges.
        ○ Machine Learning Models: Implement models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders for anomaly detection, which can be trained on historical data to detect outliers or anomalies.
        ○ Real-Time Detection: Implement a system to monitor real-time reconciliation data and flag anomalies as they occur. This can be done with time-series analysis or anomaly detection models that work well with sequential data.
    3. Root Cause Analysis:
        ○ After detecting an anomaly, analyze which data points (transactions, categories, or accounts) were affected and highlight potential causes of the discrepancy. You could use:
            § Data Correlation Analysis: Find correlations between anomalous data and potential root causes (e.g., a specific transaction category or account).
            § Clustering Techniques: Use clustering (e.g., k-means) to identify groups of transactions that are unusual.
            § Trend Analysis: Compare the anomalous transaction against historical trends to see if it's an outlier.
    4. Integration with Reconciliation Tools:
        ○ Build a REST API or other connectors to integrate with existing reconciliation software tools. You can make the system automatically flag anomalies, generate reports, or trigger alerts within those tools.
        ○ Ensure that the data pipeline from reconciliation tools to the anomaly detection system is seamless and that results can be pushed back into the tool for manual review (if needed).
    5. User Interface and Reporting:
        ○ Create dashboards or visualizations (e.g., using Power BI, Tableau, or Dash in Python) to display detected anomalies, their possible root causes, and trends over time.
        ○ Include details such as time of detection, transaction ID, affected account, and anomaly score.
    6. Automation & Error Reduction:
        ○ Automate data input, anomaly detection, and reporting to reduce manual intervention.
        ○ Implement a feedback loop to improve the model's accuracy over time by incorporating user feedback (e.g., whether an anomaly is legitimate or a false positive).
